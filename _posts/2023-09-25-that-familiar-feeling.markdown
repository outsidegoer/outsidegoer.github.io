It had been a long time since I felt that way. First days are rare, and I can't really imagine anyone getting used to them. I don't know how other people feel, but it's usually a pretty rough day. How much of that is on me? I'd say about 70%. First day and I already skipped my workout and woke up an hour late instead. Once I arrive at school I see people already in class. That's a weird shift. I'm usually used to being the first one in class beause:
1. small class sizes
1. everyone else was really, REALLY bad with time

Whatever. My fault. I should have been the first one in. 

Lectures went how I expected them to go. Nothing was covered, and they tell you to study hard regularly. They tell you to balance your academic and social life. They then proceed to cover maybe 3 sentences worth of syllabus information and then dismiss you. Same shit everyone goes through every year. 

What really did surprise me though was the fact that everyone seemed to have made friends already. It had been less than a day. I don't know if I was imagining this or not, but it's really weird to be in a setting like that and know absolutely nobody, especially when you have free sessions. I didn't think it would be much of an issue, but because I had nothing of substance to study in the library, I guess I just noticed it more. I believe the first day anywhere feels like this to everyone, and I'm not sure what to make of it. 

I did end up talking to someone, but I don't think we'll end up particularly close friends (or friends at all?). I'm not really sure how quickly I'll end up making friends, and I'm not even sure how to go about it. I've heard all sorts of advice, and it's not uncommon for what one person says to directly contradict what another person says. Unlike before, it's not like I can just *not make friends* because I need a support system. I need connections and people I can rely on. 


Still, making friends isn't something I usually have to care about, and starting fresh can be extremely tough and demotivating. Everyone has to do it at some point, but I've probably put myself at a slight disadvantage by having narrow interests and not being on social media. I'll probably be fine though.
