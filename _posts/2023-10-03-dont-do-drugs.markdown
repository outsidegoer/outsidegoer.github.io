On my way home, I saw a man passed out. In large cities, it isn't really odd (especially on sundays) to see someone drunk and passed out, but this was particularly strange as it was right in front of a major building. Most people just walked past the man, assuming there was nothing wrong. What I found particularly strange was the way the man was dressed: he was wearing a neat pair of jeans and had a backpack on. He had a can of beer resting between his thighs, and was holding a lighter. Next to him were two bottles of water, which I believe were sealed (I can't say for sure though). 

I didn't think there was anything wrong with him at first, but it isn't normal to dose off in that place. I tried waking him up, but he wouldn't budge. Someone could have easily robbed him at that very moment, and I wasn't sure whether to leave him alone or not. There was no way this man intentionally fell asleep there. Another bystander eventually asked me to check his pulse, but I couldn't feel anything (no idea why). He seemed to be breathing normally though. 

After going inside the building to tell the person at the desk what happened, he said there was not much that could be done other than to call the paramedics. The bystander then called the paramedics, and told them what happened. I assume this was fairly common, and they would have dealt with cases like this before. They were about to send an ambulance, when a second bystander walks up to us and says that it was almost certainly heroin use. He slaps the man, and he wakes up.

After telling us to cancel the ambulance, the man asks for money to buy a box of cigarettes, and tells us he wants to "sell them". Maybe he did, but that's a weird thing to tell bystanders after you've passed out in front of a large prominent building and been woken up. From the way he spoke, he was almost certainly on something, and acted weird. When we refused to get him his cigarettes, he just got up and left, carrying only one of his two water bottles. He said he didn't want the second one in an agressive tone, but a bystander carried for him nevertheless. 

This is a pretty normal occurence, but I found it particularly weird and depressing because I grew up sheltered and was generally not exposed to drug abuse and people passing out on the street. I've seen my fair share of drunks, but it's far from the same as this. He's probably going to do some more heroin, and pass out again. I don't know if he could die this way, but it's a reminder to not do drugs. 

Drugs like heroin effectively allow you to give up control of the most important asset you have. You're not only risking your life, but you're losing power over yourself, and fucking with your brain in ways we don't even know about yet. These drugs can ruin peoples lives, and unfortunately I don't believe there's a way to take it responsibly, at least in my case. Unlike drinking (and in some cases smoking), it isn't even a social thing. There's no reason to start it. 

I've been seeing weird things in this city every day, but sadly I can't (don't want to) write about them. This is probably the most serious/depressing/boring post I've written so far. Everyone knows you shouldn't do drugs, but clearly something is off if people are still dying because of drug abuse. I'm not saying it should be legal/illegal/stigmatised or anything, but I hope people understand that using heroin without a prescription (if people are given any at all?) is not a good thing and should not be normalised. 

I've seen shit like e-cigarettes become super normalised and it's honestly a disgusting habit as well which is being peddled by a predatory industry. In high school, the grade below me ended up having several chronic vapers, who couldn't go a school day without a puff. They aren't even adults yet. The worst part is this is a *global* phenomenon. These people will walk up to you and tell you it's healthy to vape. Clearly, they have no understanding of the consequences of doing so. On my way back from an outing, I saw someone vape on a bus. 

I have an aversion to smokers in particular because of passive smoke. If you are drinking, or even doing lines of coke, my health doesn't necessarily degrade because of your habits. However, cigarette smoke/vape clouds make me physically sick, and I genuinely can't handle them. If you smoke/vape in a closed space, **fuck you**. Vape shops and shady high schoolers are willing to sell anyone with a pulse an ecig, including stupid 14 year olds with no self control or responsibility. It's caused a *visible* increase in the number of people on the street vaping.

Again, I'm not saying that you're a bad person for smoking/vaping. In fact, I think that mindset is stupid and self righteous. However, I do believe that it isn't acceptable to burn things in public, and I hate that society makes a convenient exception for cigarettes and ecigs. You're an asshole if you don't put your cigar/cigarette/ecig away when asked politely by someone else in an enclosed space. Your degenerate habit shouldn't be my problem. Get help.

Hopefully drugs like heroin don't ever become as widespread as tobacco and ecigs. I can only hope.
