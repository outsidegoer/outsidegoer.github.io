Yeah. I finally took the leap and made a blog. I've been reading a couple of actively maintained blogs by my friends, and it seemed to be a great idea. A (basically) self hosted platform where you could share your views and ideas on your own terms. In other words, many of the benefits of having social media without having the zucc spy on you and the glowies remove your posts. Why am I doing this? Probably peer influence. I've made it very clear that I take immense pride in the company that I keep.

Unfortunately, I'm in a bit of a sticky situation at the moment, so I won't be able to house any physical infrastructure for a good while. In fact, I may not be able to use a VPS either. That's why I'm using Github Pages. Unfortunately it's owned by Microsoft, but it seems to give me enough freedom to do whatever the fuck I want here. In the future, I hope to stop using Github Pages and get my own domain and server. 

Like every other human on this planet, I have the urge to procrastinate. I have a lot of tech projects that I might want to host, most of which would genuinely make my life easier (and the world a better place). I have the knowledge required to host whatever I feel like hosting. Even in places where I don't, the skills required involve a relatively small learning curve.

*So why do I not have these services running yet?*

I'm lazy and short on cash. I don't have servers yet. However, I think this blog could serve as the start of something new, and my future circumstances might allow me to host something I'm passionate about. By the end of this year, I expect this blog to be only one of multiple services that I host myself. I'll find a way to make time for this because it's probably a more productive activity than doomscrolling on reddit. Hold me accountable.
