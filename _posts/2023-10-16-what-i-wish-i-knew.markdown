It's been a month, and probably one of the scariest ones of my life. I constantly end up reminding myself that I am indeed in a different country. I live alone. I need to get onto my own two feet and start taking responsibility for my shit. The past month, I've been doing a variety of things, such as setting up accounts, trying to meet new people, and learning more about the area I live in. It's certainly a huge change, but it's one I quite like. 

Yet, I don't really feel at home here yet. I'm adjusting pretty quickly to how things work, and because I never really felt at home where I previously lived, I can't even really describe what I feel as homesickness. I guess I'm lost. That's the word. Everything feels so unnaturally temporary, and I'm only settling in to my daily/weekly routines, which will change once I'm able to work. Nevertheless, I've become slightly less lost each week, and I guess that's what moving feels like. I didn't think I'd forget, but I always do. 

There's a lot of stuff people told me before I moved, and a lot of it turned out to be bullshit. Some of this will vary depending on the school/region you're in, but I'm going to talk about what I think everyone should know before they move out for university. It's incredibly subjective, and this is based only on my first month in a new country.

## 1. Learn to Cook
Someone I met last week told me that since they moved here they've basically survived on cornflakes. Oof. Sure, they're cheap, but I'd probably die if that was all I ate. It's bland, nutritionless food that isn't even filling. Knowing how to make basic meals has kept me afloat on much, MUCH less money than most people, and it's not even that hard. I'm not really the type of person to spice my food too much, and it often requires less than an hour of meal prep each day. Buying frozen vegetables and having access to an oven allows you to make yourself a nutritious meal with basically no effort, and even if it tastes shit, you'll go to bed full and you won't be destroying your body.

Even if you don't care about your health, eating out and meal plans are infinitely more expensive than cooking stuff yourself. It's not that hard and can be sort of satisfying at times. Also, fruit is probably one of the easiest ways to get nutrition. I always have two bags of fruit in the kitchen, and I just take a fruit whenever I'm hungry. Where you live, these are likely to be ridiculously cheap as well.

## 2. Know the Cost of Moving
Moving is expensive. Really. Fucking. Expensive. I'm convinced there's no real way for you to calculate the cost of moving and plan accordingly. There's so much stuff I'd forgotten (or didn't have space to pack), and loads of extra stuff I needed to buy because it would have taken up baggage space. Eventually, I purchased most of what I needed to live, but there's probably more left. Assume the cost of moving is at least 3 times what you currently expect it to be. You're going to go broke buying stuff (stuff you need). 

Of course, there are ways to reduce this cost. Plan ahead for the move, and learn to be a little more minimalist than you are right now. Get rid of stuff you don't use. Only bring the bare minimum, but fit anything that's compact and cheaper where you currently are in your bag when you move. 

## 3. Get a Water Bottle
Back where I used to live, I had a water bottle I carried around. Like an idiot, I didn't bring it here. Buying another bottle, however, allows me to carry water with me everywhere. I still don't drink nearly enough water, but switching from a 500ml bottle to a 1L one has kept me way more hydrated than I used to be. 

## 4. Your Professors Are Lazy
Maybe they aren't *lazy*, but they certainly care much, **much** less about what they cover and what you understand in class. I've already seen professors whiz through certain really important/complex topics after a solid 10 minute introduction with no useful content. Hell, I've seen professors outright refuse to cover content, instead insisting you watch their videos on a topic. In High School, I could have been relatively confident I would know most of what I need to simply by attending lectures. Not in college. 

Now, you may ask what the fucking point of college is then. Isn't most information already free on the internet? Can I not just spend 10 minutes and find a completely open source version of a university course and just go through that again for a fraction of the price? Well, yes you can. However, employers cream at the sight of a college diploma and so people like you and I have to shell out money for access to information that's free online.

Now then, I am a law abiding citizen, and so I must advise you all very wisely to never ever go to these illegal sites:
- annas-archive dot org 
- libgen dot is
- zlibrary24tuxziyiyfr7zd46ytefdqbqd2axkmxm4o5374ptpc52fad dot onion

It is very bad that these sites offer terabytes of knowledge and information for free as it really hurts the multimillion dollar publishers and is very illegal. Please do not download books and copy them to a kindle with callibre and a USB A to USB-B/C cable as this means Jeff Bezos can't buy another multimillion dollar yacht (he needs one to live). It is also very sad that these sites allow you to read books without a trial at no additional fee. Please do not also search for a book title followed by "vk" as vkontakte users often put books up for free. 

## 5. Go Easy on the Booze
Don't drink excessively (>120ml pure ethanol), and don't ever have enough for you to forget what you were doing the night before. Avoid hard drugs as a whole, and try not to smoke or vape. That's a gross habit. It's pretty self explanatory. Remember, it is socially acceptable to repeatedly stab someone in the stomach if they pull out an e-cigarette. Hard drugs are expensive, so only buy them if you plan to overdose and you don't need your money anyways. 

## 6. Get Rid of Your Clothes
You're probably not going to have a washing machine as a student. Therefore, you're going to need to use laundromats, which often charge per wash. Washing your clothes once a week generally seems to be a pretty decent idea, but there are 2 reasons I suggested getting rid of clothes:
1. Delicates
2. Space

Delicates are the fucking worst. You have to wash them at a low temperature, and then they'll have stupid fucking warnings like "dO nOt TuMble Dry". It's inconvenient to air dry clothes. Just get clothes you can throw in the dryer, and you can save yourself loads of time (and money) by simply using a single wash cycle. It's also better for the environment. You probably don't need nearly as many clothes as you have, so do yourself and some poor kid in africa a favour and donate clothes you don't need or are too much of a hassle to wash. Of course, maybe I'm just salty that I have a poor taste in clothing and I look homeless no matter what I wear. 

I guess most of this doesn't make sense, but I haven't really been active in group chats lately, so I guess this post is a way for me to just discuss some of my thoughts. You're probably going to disagree with some (or all) of it. Feel free to go on a rant about how wrong I am in my DMs on signal. I'll probably reply. I've found that these things have either made my life easier/would have made my life easier.
