Oh well. It's almost been two weeks now, and this place is starting to feel more like home. I've stopped getting lost, I'm more used to the weather, and the number of one time expenses I need to incur each week is going down. Moving cities isn't a particularly new experience for me, and I've done it before a couple times. Now that I'm an adult, things are a bit different. I need to start taking responsibility for everything that happens to me. 

I talked about it in my previous post, but probably the hardest part about moving is making new friends. No matter how many people are in the same boat as you, it's hard not to feel left out, or to panic and assume you're doing something wrong. Honestly, maybe I am. There are a set of people that I have started talking to regularly, but I wouldn't really call them friends. I read somewhere that you need to spend at least 50 hours with a person to call them a friend, and I've spent about 12-15 hours at most with any one individual. That's not to say that I won't make friends, just that I don't have any over here *at the moment*.

Being someone very interested in technology, it's almost ironic that I think it's impacted social interactions negatively. Aside from the additional awkwardness that comes with people scrolling through their feeds (do I disturb them?), people generally have shit attention spans and have forgotten how to be bored and talk to people (myself included). Thankfully, most platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc.) can be quit without really sacrificing much of your social life. 

Probably the most difficult one to live without is Instagram. People just assume you have it, and it's used pretty well as a form of mass communication. Clubs and societies will post information there. People will talk about themselves there. I've seen people make friends through the app, and it's often hard to forget that you've chosen not to join. It's not something you can just not think about, because not doing what everyone else does is expensive â€” socially, economically, or otherwise. 

I'm not particularly sure if I'm limiting how much I can interact with others if I don't have IG, but I can certainly say it's led to me being out of the loop a non-negligible number of times. Is that a bad thing? I'm not really sure, but it's easy to feel judged for it. I've considered joining with various restrictions on my usage, but every time I make a pros/cons list, the cons outweigh the pros. Others I know have told me about how addictive the platform can be, and how it's designed to make you *feel* like you're making more friends. 

A lot of my close friends and relatives have had their social media usage rise to a point where it's chronic and extremely visible. These people can't go an hour without checking social media, whether it's on public transport, at a restaurant, or during class. I'm not there yet, and while I do hold enormous amounts of love and respect for these people and what they do, I'd say this kind of behaviour functions as a sort of *anti-vision*. My friend (you know who you are) wrote a blog about this a few weeks ago, and this "anti-vision" keeps me away from the Zucc. 

In the past two years, I have heavily redefined my relationship with technology, and it's led to some good outcomes. It has also led to some terrifying discoveries about both myself and others, many of which I've covered before, either here or somewhere else. I can confidently say that I've improved things that matter (privacy, security, concentration, and battery life), and gotten rid of the digital clutter. I'd strongly recommend everyone reads Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport, which talks about the unhealthy control technology has over much of us.

I'm still working on it, making small tweaks to my workflow and the way I do things in order to keep myself alive. The increased amount of walking that I end up doing allows me to take calls, which I have come to prefer over text. That's a change I didn't particularly like earlier, but it's helped me explain more complicated topics effectively while on the go, while reducing my chances of ending up roadkill. 

Overall, I'm not sure how much this transformation has affected (and will continue to impact) my social life, but as the world moves in a direction I don't like, I guess I'll find things harder. It's worth noting that I met some of my closest friends today though Discord, and meeting new people in person looks incredibly challenging. I'll probably need to come to terms with the fact that I'll end up making fewer friends and I'll always be seen as the odd one out, but I know it's better than losing control over my own thoughts.
