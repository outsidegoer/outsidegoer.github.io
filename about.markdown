This is my blog. I plan to post my thoughts here, or at least the ones I feel like sharing. Since I don't use the zucc app (for millions of reasons, I've probably already told you why), this is probably the second best way to know what's going on in my life. Of course, if you have a thought or just want someone to talk to (assuming you know me IRL), you can always text me on Signal and I'd be happy to talk to you. Some of the things I might post about here include:

- Technology and digital rights
- My workflow
- Things that happen in my life

Hopefully doing this won't dox me, but if it does I'm not too concerned for personal reasons I may or may not cover later.
