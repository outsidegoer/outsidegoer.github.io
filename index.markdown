# Welcome
This uses Jekyll, a static site generator. It might have too many features, so maybe I'll sit down one day and make my own site generator. Nothing I haven't done before in my free time. Until then, feel free to read all my posts, or talk to me about any specific post if you feel like it. I'll try and add comment sections soon, but until then there's an email you can use to contact me, though it might be faster to use signal.
